<div align="justify">
<center><p><b>Happy Happy birthday, Siz!</b> 😚 First of all, hindi kasi tayo nagkikita kita kaagad and 
wala din akong gift kasi hindi nga naten sure when tayo magkikita kaya I’ve decided na gawin nalang ‘to for you. ✨ 
Super simple lang huhu but I hope you like it! 
Happy happy birthday to my Couz! 💕 We’re finally an adult na talaga like hindi na talaga tayo teenager. 🥺 
Time flies so fast but I am so grateful for you! I really admire how selfless you are. Sa super selfless mo, 
ang rupok mona 🤣 charot HAHA but seriously, I know na this college time lang tayo naging super close talaga 
since hind nga tayo madalas magkakasama kasi malayo kayo, but Thank you kasi you trust me a lot. I appreciate 
the little things na ginagawa mo for me. I know na nagkaron tayo ng something, but I am so overwhelmed and grateful 
and nakakatouch talaga ng sobra na minessage moko and you opened your heart again, you opened your trust again sakin.
<b> Ako. Una. </b> Kaya, I will forever remember that day. Thank you so much for everything. I know that you are soft 
hearted, kasi same 😂 Like sometimes, kahit words, ansakit sakit satin, pero alam mo yun super rupok natin na napapatawad 
padin natin yung nga taong di naman deserve yun pero we will make it pass nalang kasi masstress pa tayo sa huli 😂 
Thank you so much for opening your doors with us. with me. I know it’s been a tough year for you but I am so happy na 
you’re starting to heal and move on from the things that will not help you grow. Thank you for growing with us again ❤️ 
Naalala ko nung time na nasa YOU.Suites ako, then you messaged me if nasan ako tas pinuntahan moko para lang ihug ako 🥺😭 
small things, small efforts but I appreciate you <b> A LOT. </b> You really deserve the WORLD. 🌎 
<br><br>

<b>I will always be here for you every step of the way. Some roads will be bumpy, some directions 
will not be as clear as it will be, but I will be there every bumpy roads and blur directions you will take. </b> 
I will support you all the way, MD. I am looking forward for the next chapters of our lives. I cannot wait to spend
more time you and sa fam natin! ❤️ I can’t wait for us to get fucking rich na so that we will go to belo or aivee 
clinic together and get our pamper done HAHAHA arte 🤣 But anyways, I hope you enjoy your 20th birthday! 🤍 
basta always remember that I am always here every step of the way. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to buy you a gift 
din since hindi nalabas nga 😭 pero I hope na you’ll appreciate this simple QR and simple website I’ve made for you. 😚 
I coded it pa even though I have things to do but this was definitely worth my time kasi it's for you!✨ I love you always and forever! ✨ 
Happy Happy Birthday, Siz! ❤️
